## Completed Fixes

### Database Structure and Setup
- Created a comprehensive database setup script (`create_database.php`) that sets up all necessary tables with proper relationships
- Added foreign key constraints to ensure data integrity
- Created a test data setup script (`setup_test_data.php`) for development and testing

### Security Enhancements
- Added CSRF protection to all forms (login, contact, appointments)
- Created a security utilities library (`includes/security.php`) that:
  - Implements proper session management
  - Sets secure HTTP headers
  - Provides CSRF token management

- Add input validation to all user-entered data
- Enforce HTTPS where possible
- Add additional protection against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection)

### Testing and Validation
- Test all functionality thoroughly
- Validate HTML/CSS
- Test on multiple browsers and devices
- Ensure all error handling works correctly

## Testing Instructions

To test the current state of the application:

1. Run the database setup script: `http://localhost/gk_lab/create_database.php`
2. Populate with test data: `http://localhost/gk_lab/setup_test_data.php`
3. Try logging in with test accounts:
   - Admin: admin@gklab.com / admin123
   - Customer: customer@example.com / customer123
4. Test the contact form, appointment booking, and other functionality

## Known Issues

- Some admin pages may still reference the old database structure
- Cart functionality may not work fully with the new security implementation
- Some pages might be missing CSRF protection
- Error handling could be improved in some areas
